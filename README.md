This is my third project in Metis Data Science Bootcamp. Topic is Telecom Customer Churn Prediction.
Customer churn has many definitions: customer attrition, customer turnover, or customer defection. They are all referring to the loss of clients or customers. This can be voluntary reasons (by choice) or involuantary reasons (example relocation).

Predictive analytic models can be used to predict customer churn by assessing their propensity/risk to churn. These models can generate a potential 'defectors' list, so that a focused customer retention marketing program can be prioritised on these customers who are most vulnerable to churn.
